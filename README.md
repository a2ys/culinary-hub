# Culinary Hub

Welcome to **Culinary Hub**! Just like GitHub is for code, Culinary Hub is for recipes. It's a platform where culinary enthusiasts can share, collaborate, and contribute to recipes made by others. Whether you're a professional chef or a home cook, this is your space to explore and enhance your culinary creativity.

### About the Project

Culinary Hub is designed to be a collaborative environment for recipes, allowing users to:

- **Share Recipes**: Upload your own recipes and share them with the community.
- **Collaborate**: Contribute to and improve recipes uploaded by others.
- **Explore**: Discover a wide variety of recipes from different cuisines and cooking styles.

### Current Status

This repository is currently **archived** due to no ongoing plans for further development. However, the idea has great potential, and we encourage anyone interested to fork the repository and continue the project.
